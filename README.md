## INTRODUCTION
The Credit Cards Market size in terms of transaction value is expected to grow from USD 14.31 trillion in 2024 to USD 17.14 trillion by 2029, at a CAGR of 3.67% during the forecast period (2024-2029). Data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) show that credit card use in India has ticked up significantly over the past year. In April 2023, India had over 8.6 crore (86 million) credit cards, up 15% from 7.5 crore (75 million) in April 2022. This number could hit the 10-crore (100 million) milestone by early 2024, with increasing credit card debt. According to the World Bank, 35% of people worldwide are in credit card debt, and According to recent data from the Nilson Report, the amount of money lost to card-not-present fraud in 2020 was six times greater than what merchants lost just one year earlier. That was not just a fluke either, as 2019â€™s numbers were already four times greater than 2018. We can reduce these numbers by increasing a trustworthy customer base. 


## Objective:
